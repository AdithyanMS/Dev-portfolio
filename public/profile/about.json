    "about": "Hi, I'm Adithyan, a passionate software developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Technology has always fascinated me, and the more I understand the more I want to learn. I spent my free time tweaking stuff on my linux pc (I use arch btw :) ), watching anime or doing workouts. \n\n A good quote to think about:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"What I cannot create, I do not understand\" \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~Richard Feynman ",
